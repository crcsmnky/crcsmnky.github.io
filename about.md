I am a Solutions Architect at [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.com), working with customers and partners. I spend most of time designing MongoDB solutions on various platforms. I also spend time delivering consulting, training, and speaking at the occaisonal event.

Before MongoDB, I worked at Ravel helping to develop a large-scale graph processing framework on top of Hadoop (based on [Google's Pregel](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1807184)). My background is in sofware engineering and I've developed systems for social network analysis, natural language sentiment, and text similarity.
